## 1. Introduction

CRLCS (Composable Real-Time Commerce in Like-Minded Societies) is a no-code social commerce platform where members own their content.

Imagine a platform where individuals can aspire to create a self-made career on their own terms, build a community and engage with their audience, where everyone has complete control and ownership of their data. Everyone shares in the prosperity and contributes to the growth and direction of the platform.

Communities are part of the platform, but publishers can modify the look and feel to match their brand or appeal. Communities can be accessed using a web domain that allows publishers to represent their business individually on the web.

## 2. Problem

We have a broken content creator ecosystem. Web2 platforms have too much control over how creators can engage with their audience and share content.

Creators are starting to decentralize by using multiple platforms and bringing their audience with them [[1]](#footnote-1).

## 3. Solution

A Web3 platform where creators have the opportunity to determine what rights they want to build into the platform.

Web3 improves data security, privacy, and scalability exceeding what is achievable on Web2 platforms [[2]](#footnote-2).

## 4. Creator Bill of Rights

Creators have the opportunity to determine what rights they want to include in the platform.

These will cover:

- Consultation and transparency

- Creator led decision making

- Direct to audience member monetization

- Low take rates

## 5. Goals and Principles

The platform provides a set of versatile tools that allow individuals to build the user interface, business infrastructure, and communication channels required to be successful in a very comprehensive manner. These tools are designed around three main core values: Modifiability, Management, and Monetization.

### 5.1 Modifiability

The concept of blocks and No-Code/Low-Code composability has become a prevalent force on the internet. Basic UI structures can be encapsulated into objects that can be combined with others to create more complicated UI structures. This idea simplifies the process of app development to a point that can be understood by most people and creates opportunities for creative individuals to produce new and innovative products.

Basic UI blocks will consist of objects including form elements, media rendering, text content, layout organization, and others. Each block has a specific set of events that it emits from user interaction and a set of hooks that can receive events from other sources. Using these basic blocks, one can combine them to create complicated UI structures like media displays, product pages with purchasing flows, and even interactive games.

At the base of the application is the concept of a page. This is a blank canvas with basic layout constraints that help the publisher produce a professional-looking display. Blocks are dragged onto this canvas and positioned in a manner that suits the publisher’s needs. Once the desired layout is complete the publisher will pay a fee to publish the configuration to the blockchain that the public network can access. If an update is required the publisher would need to pay an additional fee to re-publish the content.

Pages and blocks also expose a set of styling options that the publisher can use to modify the look and feel to match their brand or appeal. Once the publisher has configured their desired styles they can be saved as a set that can be applied to other pages and blocks.

Page and block configurations can be published to a public library that others can access and use in their pages or communities. This allows members to share their creations with the platform and help build the functionality together.

Pages can be grouped together and linked through a provided web domain that allows a publisher to represent their business individually on the web.

### 5.2 Management

Governance is a major part of any community and economy. Disputes need to be arbitrated. Honesty needs to be encouraged and dishonesty needs to be discouraged. The well-being, equality, and security of every individual are paramount in promoting prosperity. This process should not be the responsibility of one individual or a centralized committee.

One method of ensuring a safe environment is to restrict access to certain individuals to create a closed community of trusted members. These settings can be configured for individual pages and blocks or on sets of pages and blocks.

In a more open environment, the system provides methods that allow the community as a whole to make decisions on handling arbitration. These include downvote and report buttons that can enforce penalties like fines and expulsion from access as well as dispute resolution processes where plaintiffs and defendants can submit their case and members of the community can vote on a resolution.

It’s important that everyone has an equal amount of voting power to ensure members cannot pool together their status in an unfair way. To pass a ruling there must be a 51% or greater vote in favour. Within a community members may opt into siding with the community leader’s decision if they do not want to participate in the vote. On a platform-wide issue members who belong to multiple communities must vote independently or explicitly choose not to participate. Each issue requiring a vote will have an expiry date upon which any member who has not yet voted forfeits their vote.

### 5.3 Monetization

Within this platform is a self-contained economy governed by blockchain technology. Members will use a cryptocurrency to transact with each other as well as the system. Publishing permanent content will cost a fee that is used to cover the cost of committing the data to the blockchain and service fees that the system will use to improve the software. Members can monetize their content, products, and services using paywalls and shopping carts. Virtually anything can be monetized from access to a collection of pages down to a single operation. This ability allows members to be very creative with business ideas and think outside of the box of conventional commerce.

A great example of a new type of business that could be created on this platform is creating blocks with specific functionality and applying a royalty cost that others must pay each time they publish the block to their page. An individual can produce a whole library of these specialized composed blocks and enjoy a passive income from the royalties.

Another example could be where members use a block template provided by a community to create a purchasable product that the community publishes to create a marketplace for other members to browse similar to Amazon.

### 5.4 Community

So where does the community feature come into play?

Alongside the commerce and content features of this platform lives a communication protocol where members can openly chat in a real-time ephemeral way. Each page will automatically be allocated a channel for discussion that can be accessed on the page or through the chat search. On top of that, anyone can create a more specific channel about any block or page and also control who has access to participate in that channel. For instance, a member can create a channel that only includes themselves and a block publisher requesting assistance or explanation of the functionality of that block.

Channels can be monetized by creating a signup block with a price attached and restricting access to the channel associated with that block based on the successful purchase. This allows members to charge for their time in one on one or group Q&A sessions. Combine that with a scheduling block and a professional consultant can then offer that block in the public library that others can publish to their pages.

Channels are inherently ephemeral where the history is only cached for a predetermined retention period. If a member would like to save the history then they can pay a fee to commit the data to the blockchain. In a group chat situation, participants can pool money together to save the history to the blockchain. This feature would be useful in a professional ideation session where a business needs to document the collaboration of the participants.

## 6. Platform Overview

This section provides an architectural overview of the platform and discusses various implementation details.

### 6.1 Identification/Authentication

The platform introduces a new concept in identification and authentication that is more in line with Web3 concepts where each member downloads a desktop and/or mobile application to manage their identity. Member IDs will be directly connected to their crypto wallet that lives on-chain. On the desktop, this application runs as a system application that should be always running. The application also includes a GUI that allows the member to manage their personal information, privacy, and security options along with their wallet information allowing them to manage their funds.

Sign up process starts with minting an NFT that represents your handle. Members may own multiple handles. Handles may be bought and sold between members at an agreed upon price.

Authentication happens by first unlocking the profile/wallet application using either a passphrase, 2FA generator, or biometrics provided by supported devices. For communities that you are already a member of you will be automatically authenticated when you visit the site through a browser. For communities that you are not a member of there will be a join button where a request will be sent directly to your wallet asking for permission to connect your profile. This process is then completed in the profile/wallet application. Once accepted, the website would redirect to the authenticated content.

### 6.2 Wallet

Each member will have a wallet generated for them when they download the profile app and complete the signup process. This wallet lives on-chain and is encrypted using a passphrase. Members are able to purchase the crypto used with the application straight from their wallet through a payment gateway like PayPal, Stripe, or other means of transferring funds. Conversion rates from the member’s local currency and the current price of the crypto that is used with the platform are supplied and verified by blockchain oracles like Chainlink. Members are also able to convert their accumulated crypto back into their local currency and have their funds transferred to their preferred financial institution.
